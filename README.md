# casstry
Cassandra project allowing for creation of some ordered lists. One can make a proposal as lists into such list. A proposal contains preferences expressed as list starting with favourite position and ending with the least favourite postion.
## Context
This project was created as a part of large scale distributed systems course at Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology. The purpouse of this project is to experience what challenges and tools are tied to designing NoSQL application with Cassandra. This project was supposed to be a console application with non-trivial design allowing temporary data inconsistency in case of network partition in distributed system.
## Issues
Inserting into proposals contains "if" statement which indeuces usage of lightweight tarnsations which are unwanted considering performance.
